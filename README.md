# CheatSheets
Cheat sheets for various projects I contribute to (PowerView, PowerUp, and [Empire](https://github.com/powershellempire/Empire)).

**Note**: PowerView and PowerUp are in the process of being integrated into the [PowerSploit](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit) repository. The bit.ly links in the current sheets note where the eventual locations will be, but these two tools still reside in [PowerTools](https://github.com/powershellempire/powertools) for the next few weeks until the transition is completed.
